        <h2>üìú About my narcissistic-self </h2>
        <p>
          Completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. This degree seems pretty cliche but oh well works good. My Major was on Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition in Neural Networks, whereas did I minor on Advanced Database Systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My grand father wanted me to be a doctor, I liked the idea of being one but was extremely demotivated because apparently "BEING A DOCTOR IS A REALLY DIFFICULT JOB", here im pursuing Engineering. Its kinda funny how now my interest lies mostly on bioinfomatics. I like doing research on complex Deep Learning Models and datas (Biological datas are mostly complex). A few examples will be given on my project section you'll see how complex I go. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Im a trend maker and a trend follower. Im not your norm-computer science student who literally stares infront of screen for 24 hours just to be the best. I have always been said by my teachers that I'm God-gifted but I rarely believe in it. Im just a regular human being who never liked staying at home.

          <ul>
            <li><h1>ReGi-PPI</h1></li>
            <p>It is a Deep Learning Model which predicts if a group of proteins interact with each other and form a network. The model was trained where the embeddings of each protein's CLS tokens were used as node features and the edges were based on whether the proteins interacted or not. The embeddings which were used as node features were extracted using the ProtBert Transformer. A graph of a PPI-network was formed which was passed through a Graph Neural Network Model which was trained to give predictions. A journal is to be published on it.</p>
            <li><h1>Face Patrol</h1></li>
            <p>It is a webapplication which basically detects an interuder within an organisation. We used state of the art model for object identfication which is YOLO-V8, which we trained based on our dataset which we collected. The admin can add users and cameras which are wire connected or wirelessly connected. If an intruder is detected it will send a signal directly to the logs and alert the system.  </p>
